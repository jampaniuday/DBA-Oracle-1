-- Update file listener.log expected to grow in time.

-- If you have a 24X7 environment and the listener can not be stopped, then you can use the following steps to rename / move the file without having to restart it: 

LSNRCTL> set current_listener <listenername>
LSNRCTL> set log_status off

-- In another window rename the log file. Then return to previous window

LSNRCTL> set log_status on

-- which will create a new and empty listener.log file which will continue logging.  â€‹
